          </div>
          <p>A governmental solution to climate change is another widely discussed avenue to a brighter future.  Proponents for this type of solution suggest that the only full-proof solution must come from governmental action. This is the most effective way of holding corporations accountable and ensuring the necessary laws are passed. So to what extent are governments capable of fighting climate change and what type of role should they play?</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>The track record of government-driven climate action isn't exactly cause for optimism. Currently, fossil fuels are subsidized to the tune of about half a trillion dollars a year.<sup>12</sup> These subsidies typically come in 2 variations. Production subsidies are tax breaks and direct funding which make fuel extraction cheaper for corporations. Consumption subsidies make energy cheaper for consumers by lowering the price below market value. It is however worth noting that fossil fuel subsidy estimates vary greatly due to a widespread lack of government transparency.</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>One of the axioms of economic growth has long been that it causes energy demand to increase. This is why fossil fuels have been the wind under the wings of economic development. It’s no secret that the countries that have contributed the most emissions also have the largest economies. The good news is that while we cannot change the reality of growing energy needs, we can change our energy sources. This is where the power of government action lies. What better way to change a system than to use those who write the rules.</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>So how can governments fight climate change? The first sector that needs to be overhauled with a package of increased regulation and targeted investment is undoubtedly the energy sector. There are a lot of creative solutions being proposed to our energy problems but the goal remains the same. We need to phase out fossil fuels by transitioning to renewable energy sources. Realistically, this will include large-scale nuclear energy use which does not directly create GHG emissions.<sup>13</sup> The need for nuclear energy stems from the biggest problem that our renewable sources still have, reliability and energy storage. Our electric grids rely on something called grid inertia for reliable electricity output.<sup>15</sup> Grid inertia is essentially a shock absorber that keeps energy output stable even when the generators aren't functioning properly. This is because of large spinning masses which remain in motion when generators temporarily stop functioning. Low inertia energy grids are prone to blackouts and are generally unreliable. The problem is that current renewable energy sources produce little to no inertia and they don't create consistent electrical output. This is why nuclear energy is an ideal solution for providing the base load while renewable sources can be used to accommodate the grid when demand rises. The other issue is energy storage. Solar doesn’t work at night, wind energy doesn’t work when it isn't windy, but what do we do when energy demand is high and output is low. Energy from periods of high output needs to be stored in batteries if we have any hope of relying on renewables for a large portion of our energy needs. We do not currently have the battery capacity to do so.</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>None of these problems will solve themselves and at this stage, government intervention is our best bet. Renewable energy sources need to receive massive subsidies on par with or exceeding those which the fossil fuel industry currently benefits from. This, paired with a decrease in fossil fuel spending will be the first step in making renewable energy cheaper than oil, gas, and coal. This type of costly endeavor will likely spell short-term economic recession, but the investments will eventually pay dividends. There is no way around the fact that climate action will require some form of initial economic sacrifice. Additionally,  battery manufacturing will also need to be heavily subsidized. The world’s governments are the only entities with the spending power required to make any of this happen. </p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>Beyond spending power, governments have the power in establishing the law and creating the agencies which enforce it. This is our best tool for industries where emissions cannot currently be avoided, namely transport and manufacturing. The chemical and construction material industries for example are energy-intensive, but greenhouse gases are also produced directly through certain production processes.<sup>16</sup> While there is a lot of work being done to make these processes CO<sub>2</sub> optimized, for the foreseeable future, carbon offsets are the most sensible solution. Carbon offsets typically compensate GHG emissions through carbon sequestration in soils and forests or through investment in renewable energy and carbon capture. While we do have carbon offset systems already in place all around the world, they are critically flawed. A study conducted in 2016 concluded that 85% of all carbon offset programs have no environmental benefits.<sup>17</sup> Retailer carbon offset traders buy large amounts of credits to amass a portfolio which is eventually sold by brokers to corporations as a bundle. The problem is that multiple companies act as brokers and retail traders, so many that it has spawned another industry of third-party auditors which have their own internal standards. This has allowed illegitimate offset credits to be sold as an opportunity to greenwash your company at little expense. The corporations which buy the credits are far too removed from the actual process of absorbing carbon from the atmosphere. With each additional level of abstraction, the benefits become less tangible and it becomes easier to fake a positive environmental impact. Not only are they not helping, but they are also detrimental in their ability to create the facade of a clean business, discouraging effective climate action. If a company is emitting more carbon because they believe they are being compensated by offset projects which don't work, the net carbon concentration in the atmosphere actually increases.</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>Many of these carbon offset projects are a result of the Kyoto protocol which has unfortunately shaped up to be yet another international treaty full of empty promises. While the Kyoto protocol did carry symbolic significance as one of the first international treaties to fight climate change, it has also set the standard for the inconsequential climate summits that followed. There needs to be complete government-driven carbon offset reform. There needs to be direct communication between companies and carbon offset projects. This means closer communication but they should also be close in physical proximity. 44% of carbon offset projects are based in developing countries.<sup>17</sup> This is noteworthy because the global north is responsible for roughly 92% of excess emissions.<sup>18</sup> Regulation is more difficult in developing countries but they attract a lot of carbon offset investment due to cheap labor. In reality, there is no good reason to have the emitters be so removed from the projects supposedly balancing their carbon budget. Ideally, both the companies and the offset projects they support should at least be based in the same country. This is ideal for regulation as well as communication. This is yet another glaring issue that only governments have the power to fix.</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>So governments are in a position to make a tremendous amount of change but why hasn't any of this taken place yet? As mentioned previously, cheap energy has become the harbinger of economic growth. This has created a highly skewed power dynamic between the governments of the world and the fossil fuel industry, one where corporations have all the leverage. Our dependency on cheap energy is so great that oil companies are in the position to bleed entire countries dry. In western countries, capital buys influence, and the oil gas and coal industries have a lot of capital. The fossil fuel industry has effectively become a political entity with some of the most influential lobbying groups in the world. On May 13th, 2021, 56 members of the US Congress signed an open letter claiming the oil and gas industry was being targeted with taxes.<sup>19</sup> One might wonder why so many representatives are concerned with the workings of the fossil fuel industry. It turns out 53 of the members who signed the letter have received money directly from the fossil fuel industry.<sup>19</sup> The total amount of money they have received exceeds 14 million dollars. Similarly, just the world’s 5 biggest oil companies have spent 251 million euros lobbying in Europe.<sup>22</sup> It's essentially an open secret at this point that many western and eastern powers are run by oil barons. China is somewhat of an outlier in that capital doesn't buy influence to the same degree. Oil production in China is dominated by 3 state-owned companies with close ties to the communist party.<sup>23</sup> This means the oil industry and the government are really one of the same. This however creates its own conflict of interest in that the government has a shared desire to see those state-owned companies flourish. So how is it that we've allowed capital power to be converted into political influence? Why does the power of market share transcend the bounds of the economy?</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>This leads us to the current neoliberal economic paradigm. A big issue is that many people think of climate solutions too simplistically because of the inherently simple equation at the heart of the problem. We need the rate of carbon output to be lower than the rate of carbon uptake (sequestration). The problem is that this type of outlook ignores all the challenging nuances of balancing the equation in practice. It may be more helpful to view the challenge of solving climate change as solving an issue like racism. Most people you know probably want to solve this issue, yet despite this, there seems to be something more fundamentally engrained in societal systems perpetuating the issue. Something that's not quite tangible and hard to quantify. For climate change, this element is neoliberal economic theory.</p>

Something that's not quite tangible and hard to quantify. For climate change, this element is neoliberal economic theory.</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>The United States is our best example of the consequences of unfettered capitalism which neoliberal economic theory advocates for. This form of economic theory which has been most widely adopted by capitalist societies suggests that any form of regulation is inefficient and stagnates growth. As a result, less government oversight is highly desirable for our development. over the last 30 years in the US, the top 1% has grown 21 trillion dollars richer and the bottom 50% 900 billion dollars poorer.<sup>24</sup> Despite this, neo-liberal economists suggest the best response to this widening wealth gap is more unregulated capitalism. While the field of economics has attracted numerous bright minds, and despite the sophisticated mathematical models underscoring neo-liberal economic theory, economics is still not a science. Even when the math checks out, there are so many variables that remain completely unquantifiable or impossible to integrate into models. It is particularly hard for economists to create testable hypotheses or to reach a consensus. This is why many academics have described economics as a dismal science.<sup>24</sup> It is also why many people are advocating for a new economics. Bad economic theory has facilitated many of the world’s biggest problems today.</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>Some of the major flaws in neo-liberal economic theory seem to be the underlying assumptions upon which it operates. The biggest of which is that the market is an efficient equilibrium system. This means that changes in one part of the market are counteracted by changes in other parts, bringing the system back to the equilibrium state. An example would be that if wages increase, jobs must decrease. The problem is however that empirical evidence actually supports the contrary. We can see this in action right now as economies recover from covid. An increase in the minimum wage is a strong tool for increasing employment.<sup>25</sup> The second big issue is a behavioral model which essentially describes every human as inherently selfish. This model says that humans act only out of self-interest and it is absolutely integral to the logic of neo-liberal economics. The problem is that this theory is objectively wrong. The prosperity we see in the world cannot be the net outcome of independently selfish acts, it's a logical contradiction. It means that all the good things that have happened are a result of selfishness, it means that under neoliberal economic theory, greed is good. It’s quite easy really to understand why this is wrong. Do we really think the doctors who invented insulin had dreams of wealth? The same doctors who sold the patent for 1 dollar and literally said “insulin doesn't belong to me, it belongs to the world”.<sup>27</sup> Time and time again some of the greatest problems we have solved are the result of a desire to help, not to accumulate unimaginable wealth. It is faulty logic that has allowed neoliberal economics to create policies that concentrate wealth into ever-shrinking portions of the population.</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>So how does this relate to the overwhelming political power of oil companies, discouraging climate action? The latest research shows that humans are not the self-centered beings that our current economic theory believes us to be. In fact, we deeply care about those around us, it is this trait after all that allowed our ancestors to thrive. This is why the market economy has been the greatest social technology ever developed. Market demand selects for problems worth solving and innovation solves the problem, creating more prosperity. As we become more prosperous our problems increase in complexity and they require more cooperation to solve. This is where neoliberal economic theory fails. The current economic paradigm absolutely discourages cooperation. Climate change is the amalgamation of our most complex issues. It will require cooperation beyond anything we've ever seen, a complete rejection of the current economic ideals. If it is not our selfishness that has created prosperity, it must be our reciprocity.</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>Somewhat paradoxically, the more “free” the markets become, the less free they truly are. When markets are left to themselves, they optimize for wealth accumulation, not growth. Market freedom means removing the limits on what money can buy, opening the doors to corruption and exploitation. Ideally, we should want market economies to be free in their ability to innovate but restricted in their capacity for exploitation. The unbound nature of our economies is directly responsible for what has become the market for legislation. The means of buying the advantage required to succeed despite ruthless competition.</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>Because it is so expensive to run political campaigns, candidates are disproportionately wealthy or well funded compared to the average person. They have benefited from the neoliberal economic scheme and so they create policies that allow themselves to continue benefiting from it at the expense of the masses. Market economies have done amazing things for us but when left unregulated they create just as many problems as solutions. Solving the climate crisis doesn't have to mean moving away from capitalism but it does mean changing the fine details of how successful capitalist economies are to be managed. As mentioned previously, fossil fuels encourage economic growth but now we know that economic growth is beneficial for mostly the top percent of earners. This is why neoliberal economic theory is not currently compatible with democracy. It has caused our leaders to serve the industries which facilitate their position in government, not the people who elect them. In essence, the influence on legislation has quietly shifted from the public to private corporations with their own agenda. Successful economies must be tended to, to ensure healthy growth. Solving climate change means reflecting on economic theory and building upon it so that we can continue to solve problems as they grow in complexity.</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>So where does this leave us? We know governments are in the perfect position to act on climate change but we also know that this is in direct conflict with their desire to maintain the current economic order. Our options are limited. According to Pew Research center, around 57% of countries are some form of democracy.<sup>27</sup> We have however already established that it's not as simple as voting for leaders who care more about climate change. The reality is that the vast majority of leaders elected under current economic systems will have some sort of monetary incentive to act in only a limited fashion. This is why the public must express disdain, not only for the actions of current leaders but for the system that has brought them to power. Germany for example is still expanding coal mines despite a pledge to completely phase out coal by 2030.28 This means that these expanded mines will have to be shut down before they even reach full production. In the meantime, Germany is also shutting down its nuclear power plants which produce infinitely cleaner electricity than coal. These are empty promises. Governments are in a position to do the most, yet somehow we still enter conversations about how environmentally conscious our paper bags and reusable water bottles are. It's not that they aren’t good, it's just that we won't save the planet one water bottle at a time. Public pressure is our strongest power. Public pressure is the best way of forcing the hands of those who make meaningful decisions.</p>
