          <p>While climate change is a heavily discussed issue, much of the discourse is and has been led by those looking to spread awareness. While there is nothing inherently wrong with this, it is no longer sufficient. For real change to occur, we need to shift the conversation away from debates about the validity of the issue and toward realistic goals and plausible solutions.</p>
         
          <p><br /></p>
          
          <p>Currently, three avenues are widely considered to hold potential as solutions to the climate crisis. The first is a market-based solution. This entails allowing our economies to continue evolving without additional government regulation. The expectation is that some sort of product or service-based solution will emerge through organic economic means. The second solution is a collective effort by which the vast majority of the global population effectively zeros its carbon footprint through lifestyle changes. Lastly, a dramatic shift in government policy and market regulation could solve the climate crisis by forcing corporations to meet certain environmental standards.</p>
          
          <p><br /></p>

          <p>At first glance, the market-based solution to climate change causes the least friction with our current economic systems. Beyond its convenience, most people are understandably comfortable putting their faith in the same innovation that has led society to its most prosperous era in history. The problem with a market-based climate solution is that it ignores the root of the problem. Market leaders are by definition benefactors of the current economic landscape. Asking them to solve the climate crisis is to ask them to deconstruct the same environment that facilitated their success. We cannot rely on the people that have benefited the most from a carbon economy to fundamentally change it. While significant capital is being invested into market-based solutions such as carbon capture, the current consensus is that this will not be some silver bullet, at least not quickly enough. While carbon capture will play a role in the wealth of solutions required to truly avert a crisis, the stakes are too high to simply bet on human ingenuity. Furthermore, If climate change is to be viewed as a symptom of our overconsumption of finite resources, a market-based solution may prevent warming but it will also encourage the same behavior that created the issue. If the market ends up pulling all the carbon out of the air, we will have an excuse to continue burning our forests, polluting our oceans, and degrading our topsoil. The natural world will continue to rot until we have exhausted all it has. A fully market-based solution will in this way only substitute one crisis for another.</p>
          
          <p><br /></p>

          <p>The second commonly proposed solution to climate change involves collective action. The idea is that if every person could take responsibility for their own carbon footprint and adjust their lifestyle accordingly, we could significantly mitigate catastrophic climate change. This is however only true in an entirely unfeasible and potentially counterproductive way. This type of solution would inevitably lead to the same type of economic and social collapse which we are trying to avoid by limiting the effects of climate change. It calls for people to stop consuming products and services which have carbon emissions associated with them. For it to be effective, every person would have to reach a net carbon output as close to zero as possible. The problem is that at a fundamental level, we rely on fossil fuels for the energy input that is required to produce or transport just about every product on the market. By “taking responsibility” most people would actively participate in the destruction of the same industries that allow them to provide for themselves. Solving the climate crisis isn't a matter of personal choice because our choices are shaped by the system within which we make them. Greenhouse gas emissions are baked in, integrated on such a level that consumers cannot avoid them. A downstream solution to climate change means that we are content with allowing corporations to pollute our world and instead of demanding them to change, we should. Even if our choices could somehow bypass the constraints of a global economy built and mobilized by fossil fuel, it still wouldn't work. With around half the world's population living on less than 6 dollars a day, how could we expect most people to spend the green premium? We can't. There is a hard cap on the effects that our lifestyle choices can have on the climate unless we are willing to abandon the luxuries of modern civilization altogether. Additionally, the consumption of goods and services cannot be the problem because this is the foundation of every economy, it's one of the primary threads maintaining social order. The problem is not that we use products that improve our lives, the problem lies in how these products are produced and distributed. Are people at fault for wanting to keep the lights on in their house, or are corporations and governments at fault for inextricably tying the desire to do so with the decay of the natural world?</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>This is where the third proposed solution comes into play. The world runs on fossil fuels because they are the cheapest and most reliable energy source but these properties aren't entirely intrinsic. Yes, fossil fuels are abundant and chemically rich with energy but so much of our reliance is a result of investment. Oil, gas and coal have the best infrastructure, and the companies that provide them receive the most in government subsidies. Fossil fuels have been made artificially cheap to lower energy costs, encouraging inflated economic growth. Subsidies in the form of tax breaks, government contracts, and limited liability for environmental damage have effectively rigged the energy sector. The “free market” has never been truly free. These subsidies were kickstarted in an attempt to increase industrial productivity and they have been very successful. The natural byproduct has been the immense profitability of the fossil fuel industry. As the size of these companies has grown, so has their influence. So much so that we have witnessed this influence bleeding into our political systems, bringing into question the relationship between our democracies and our economies. The intersection between campaign finance and government lobbying is complex and heavily contested. There is however no doubt that campaign finance has created the opportunity for the private sector to advance goals that may not represent social interests at large. The price tag attached to political campaigns in countries with the largest economies is significant. This is where companies like Exxon and Chevron come into play. When you have large pools of capital to invest in the most impressionable or desperate politicians, it's easy to win favorable odds the next time fossil fuel-related legislation is voted on. The success of fossil fuels has created an immense amount of leverage, undermining the integrity of our politicians and compromising the legitimacy of the democratic process. If these differences cannot be reconciled, it is time to start asking whether capitalism as currently structured is compatible with democracy, are the people electing our leaders or is capital?</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>The good news is that we have collectively created this system and we can collectively change it. Our leaders cannot currently commit to climate action because the majority of people have yet to afford them the opportunity.  Climate action will be tremendously costly, the short-term economic impacts would certainly hamper any possibilities for reelection. This is where the true collective action solution comes into play. The personal sacrifice needed to fix this issue is rooted in a tolerance for the inevitable hardship that the fight against climate change will cause. Economies will suffer and it will be challenging but it will be better than climate catastrophe. Climate action will involve the reallocation of spending from areas such as healthcare, defense budgets, and other sectors we benefit from heavily. Only when we are prepared to make these sacrifices will true action be possible. If our leaders are convinced that the socioeconomic consequences of swift and thorough climate action won't spell political suicide, then we will position ourselves to work toward a solution.</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>While it may feel like all is lost, we cannot lose hope as this will only cement the fate we so dearly hope to avoid. The world seems to be heading toward a trajectory that will avoid the worst of climate change but we must not lose our sense of urgency. It is also very important that we remain keenly aware of the issue we are fighting. Greenhouse gas emissions are only one part of the larger whole that constitutes our relationship with the natural world.</p>
