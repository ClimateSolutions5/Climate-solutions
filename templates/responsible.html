            <h1 class="h2">002 : The Personal Responsibility Solution</h1>
          </div>
          <p>Perhaps the most widely discussed solution to the climate issue involves personal responsibility. The logic follows that as consumers we have the power to change our behavior and save the planet. So is this true, is there merit to a solution as trivial as making lifestyle decisions?</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>First, we need to establish the origin of this sentiment to understand the underlying motivation. Most of us have heard at some point that a reduction in our carbon footprint by flying less, eating less meat, and using sustainable products is the key to solving the climate crisis. Where was the concept of an individual's carbon footprint born and why has it become the center of the debate about climate change solutions?</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>Many people don’t know that the term “carbon footprint” was popularized by one of the most successful PR campaigns in history. This was the campaign by British Petroleum in 2000 that planted the seed which poisoned the mind of the public conscience,<sup>8</sup> a seed that has blossomed into the full-scale perversion of climate activism. In the late 20th century the fossil fuel industry had begun seeing the in the IIIII. When Professor James E. Hansen testified before the American senate in 1988 about the dangers of climate change,<sup>10</sup> the world was just starting to understand the gravity of the situation. This prompted BP to hire the PR firm Ogilvy and Mather who spearheaded this masterfully crafted exercise in damage control.<sup>9</sup> The campaign began with a commercial that follows “random” pedestrians being asked what carbon footprint means to them and promptly giving an answer involving personal responsibility. This commercial coincided with BP’s rebranding as Beyond Petroleum. In 2004 BP unveiled its carbon footprint calculator which was used by 300,000 people alone in the same year. Not only was the narrative fading into a story about personal responsibility, but now people could quantify the severity of their environmental sins. The oil industry had started shifting the blame.</p>
          
          <p><br /></p>

          <p>Fast forward to today and every environmental agency you can imagine has produced its own version of the carbon footprint calculator. The internet is littered with articles such as BBC’s “Climate change: Top 10 tips to reduce carbon footprint revealed” or “How to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint” by the New York Times. The concept of a carbon footprint has infiltrated virtually every corner of the climate change debate. The problem is that this idea exists only to serve the fossil fuel industry and has very little grounding in reality. So to what extent are emissions a result of deliberate consumer choices? A study conducted by MIT in 2008 concluded that a homeless person in the US that ate in soup kitchens and slept in shelters would contribute about 8.5 tonnes of CO2 annually. For perspective, the average US citizen today contributes about 16 tonnes annually.<sup>11</sup> Even a person at the very bottom of the consumerism hierarchy can’t cut their footprint below half that of the average citizen. This illustrates that our carbon footprint is not a matter of choice, how could it be when cutting just about all your consumption still doesn’t zero your carbon output. This begs the question ”if our personal choices aren’t overwhelmingly responsible for our carbon footprint, what is?”. Studies that estimate carbon footprint allocate the footprint of public infrastructure equally among the population of the country in question. This means the average carbon footprint per capita is really an aggregate that represents the output of infrastructures such as roads, the police, libraries, and the military. The rest of the 16-tonne annual average which the homeless person does not contribute largely comes from unavoidable activities for modern citizens. This includes driving to work, heating your home, and having a varied diet. The carbon footprint is really a representation of a systemic issue, not an emergent one. The flaw is not in our decision to heat the house during winter. The flaw is how the system accommodates this choice.</p>
          
          <p><br /></p>

          <p>BP has expertly navigated a field of linguistic land mines to direct the blame at us. The effectiveness of BP’s original campaign cannot be understated.  It hasn’t only deflected the blame, it has completely drained the energy from a lot of environmental activism. Debates about climate action routinely devolve into backward virtue-signaling contests where your validity as an activist depends on your actions to decrease your carbon footprint, which we now know is largely an exercise in futility. Fossil fuel companies want nothing more than this because if being an activist requires you to have virtually no carbon footprint, the environmental movement will consist of maybe 10 people. Debates about personal carbon footprint are at heart nothing more than a victim-blaming charade, distracting us from the true culprits. Additionally, this narrative has very much contributed to the depressive outlook of today's youth. If climate action is to be this collective change in consumerism that the fossil fuel companies have painted it to be, then all hope is already lost, how could we conceive of this type of action in a world where most people are just trying to get by. In this case, why bother trying to solve an untenable issue? This has become the underlying ethos fueling climate inaction for many, playing directly into the hand of fossil fuel giants.</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>Our choices are confined to the bounds of the system within which we make them and currently it is a system plagued by the fossil fuel industry. Having to drive a car to work or watching tv at home does not make you responsible for climate change. These are simply the rules of the current system we have all been born into. Any rhetoric that somehow depicts our everyday unavoidable activities as the equivalent of drilling into the earth’s crust and pumping out hydrocarbons with our bare hands is extremely misguided. There simply is no other way to currently participate in society than to support industries that create vast amounts of emissions. We should not be content with demanding ourselves to change instead of the companies that have a monopoly on our everyday utilities. The system needs to change from its very foundation.</p>
      
          <p><br /></p>

          <p>None of this should discourage making different lifestyle choices. Driving less, consuming less meat, or sourcing your products from local businesses are all great decisions that can benefit your health and your community. It does however mean we need to keep our expectations realistic. These types of choices can be helpful in several ways but they cannot solve climate change, even if every single person followed suit. We cannot solve a systemic issue by making different decisions from within the flawed system. The options are to abandon the system and by extension modern civilization, or to change the system. A top-down solution will never reach the foundation of society's inner workings, namely energy production, food production, transport, and waste management.</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>Climate activists are to some extent also culpable in spreading this false narrative. As mentioned previously, the internet is littered with articles and news clips of well-meaning people giving “tips” on reducing carbon footprint. They are missing the point and it has massively eroded the effectiveness of environmental activism. Additionally, even if this type of solution did make sense, it would undoubtedly lead to economic collapse. Taking this argument to its logical conclusion leads to the collapse of all but the explicitly vital industries. Take cars for example. If we all stopped driving tomorrow, car companies would all go under. As a consequence, the companies that sell raw materials to car manufacturers would suffer. Car insurance companies would all cease to exist. Any construction company focused on road maintenance would lose its purpose. The companies that sell materials to the construction companies would suffer. Millions of workers would lose their livelihood and this is just one example. The reality is that everyone’s livelihood depends on the web of consumerism in one way or another. We can’t just stop buying products. This is why the personal responsibility narrative is invalid and has done more to delegitimize climate action than actually help.</p>
