          </div>
          <p>One of the more controversial routes toward a climate solution is the market-based solution. In essence, the advocates of this type of solution suggest that we don’t need to worry since technology will inevitably save us courtesy of the free market. It isn’t hard to see why this solution appeals to so many people. The last century has seen humanity solve some of its greatest problems through the means of technological innovation. From the computer to the advent of AI, we have achieved some truly amazing things. Somewhat ironically, the fossil fuel industry has been the beating heart of much of this innovation. So if technology has done right by us so far, why would it fail us now?  Additionally, many of the biggest companies in the world invest heavily in market-based solutions such as carbon capture,<sup>1</sup> further lending credence to the legitimacy of a market-based approach.</p>

          <p><br /></p>

          <p>Market-based climate solutions typically come in two variations. The first is a policy-focused approach such as cap and trade systems or a carbon tax and the second is a product-focused approach such as carbon capture technology. While the former is technically a market-based approach, it hinges on legislative action and for this reason, I consider it more of a governmental solution than a market solution. Therefore, this section will focus on exploring the merit of carbon capture technology as the market’s response to pleas for climate action.</p>
          
          <p><br /></p>
        
          <p>So far, carbon capture has been most widely implemented and useful at the source of industrial production. This is commonly at power plants or in industrial complexes where carbon capture has been shown to store over 90% of carbon dioxide emissions from exhaust vents.<sup>2</sup> So what is holding this technology back from solving the climate crisis? At the moment carbon capture has yet to achieve true economic viability. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) units are expensive and the stored CO<sub>2</sub> isn’t cheap enough to compete with CO<sub>2</sub> produced as a byproduct of other industrial processes.3 If the stored CO<sub>2</sub> cannot be sold, the entire process becomes a massive money vacuum. This means the only reason for CCS implementation is a concern for the climate, something that hasn’t been widely demonstrated by corporations. Additionally, CCS itself uses electricity which needs to be sourced from renewables to ensure the unit is having a net positive effect. Lastly, the largest market for CO<sub>2</sub> from CCS units has been the fossil fuel industry which uses the gas to pump out even more hydrocarbons in a process called enhanced oil recovery.<sup>3</sup> This means that some CCS use is encouraging us to burn even more fossil fuels.</p>
         
          <p><br /></p>

          <p>The second less developed form of carbon capture is direct air capture (DAC). DAC differs from traditional CCS in that it operates in open environments with low CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations to pull CO<sub>2</sub> directly out of the air. Effectively CCS is used to prevent would-be emissions and DAC is used to store past emissions. The challenge with DAC is that the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the open air is on average extremely low. This means DAC needs a lot more energy to operate effectively than traditional CCS. So much so that some of the DAC systems require almost the equivalent amount of energy to operate as what was released by the carbon they are absorbing.<sup>4</sup> The energy cost is so high that some people believe investment in DAC is detrimental to the cause. A study published by Nature Communications concluded that for large-scale DAC implementation, DAC would have to use about a quarter of the global annual energy production by 2100.<sup>5</sup> Even this study makes large assumptions about the scalability of DAC and concedes that the raw material cost will be extremely high. DAC is in many ways a far larger gamble than CCS, both the risks and rewards are greater.</p>
          
          <p><br /></p>

          <p>Carbon capture is still multiple innovations away from becoming cost-effective but does it have a future? The most recent IPCC report has essentially concluded that if we have any hope of hitting our climate goals, carbon capture will play a role. Carbon capture will be significant but it probably won't be the elegant natural solution many people believe it to be. Two scenarios are possible. We may achieve breakthroughs in the technology at some point in the coming years. These breakthroughs could render the technology cost-effective, encouraging widespread implementation. The problem is that it's impossible to predict this type of improvement in novel technologies like CCS. Some technologies do improve predictably such as computing power which increases exponentially.<sup>4</sup> These technologies however need to reach a threshold performance metric before achieving the inflection point that precedes exponential growth. Nobody knows when CCS will be there. The more likely outcome is that CCS implementation will be the result of brute force legislative action. If the market cannot produce a CCS product that incentivizes businesses to use it, the government will have to force them to. At this point, CCS won’t be a market solution as much as it is a legislative one. In this way, CCS does not have a future as a market-based solution per se. If that is the case, it will be up to us to elect the leaders that believe in it as a solution. That being said, CCS alone will not be enough. The fact of the matter is that climate change cannot be stopped without a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions regardless of how much we invest in CCS and DAC.</p>
          
          <p><br /></p>

          <p>There are also serious questions to be asked about where carbon capture investment is coming from and why. Data gathered by the Heinrich Böll Foundation indicates that an excess of 85% of all CCS projects have fossil fuel industry backing and 80% of commercial CCS plants being developed currently plan on using enhanced oil recovery.<sup>6</sup> Additionally, carbon capture technology continues to struggle despite substantial investment. The Petra Nova Carbon Capture project for example cost an estimated 1 billion dollars including almost 200 million in public funding.<sup>7</sup> Despite this, the plant was closed in 2021 due to financial reasons.<sup>6</sup> This project is only one of several which cost hundreds of millions of dollars and are still closed due to costs.<sup>6</sup> None of this paints carbon capture as a profitable investment, so why are some of the most successful companies ever still injecting so much money into it? Is this some altruist concern for the health of the planet? No. CCS investment by the industry is a strategic bid to maintain the current industrial order. What better reason is there to continue burning hydrocarbons than a capacity to absorb all the pollutants produced by them? CCS can in this context be seen as the last-ditch effort of an industry that knows it is dying. </p>
          
          <p><br /></p>

          <p>CCS needs to work in unison with a decrease of emissions not in replacement of it. CCS implementation is not the natural evolution of industry and it won’t happen without deliberate regulatory intervention. CCS cannot become an excuse to continue reaping the oceans, burning the forests, and polluting the land that sustains us. We will need to use it but ultimately CCS implementation serves those already at the top of the economic ladder and it may facilitate further degradation of the world’s ecosystems. This is why we should view CCS as a cog in the machine that fights climate change, not the engine that drives it.</p>
